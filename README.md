### `Actor` class hierachy
- `Actor` is an abstract base class for object with a position, and `Wall` + `NonWall` inherits from it.
    - **Stationary objects** (`Drop` and `Merchant`) inherit from `Wall`. 
    - **Moving objects** (`Hero` and 
`Monsters`) inherit from `NonWall`.

- `Hero` and `Monster` also inherit from `HasInitiative`.
    - This gives them a speed value (1 through 40) for combat turn order.
      
- `Hero` subclasses include Aleph, Bet, Gimel, Dalet, He, Vav, Zayin, and Chet.
- `Monster` subclasses include Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, and Hotel.
    - `Foxtrot` is the game's **Boss**.
